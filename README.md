# Input2ESP
 
> Project is work in progress

An Android app for sending keyboard input to a USB HID enabled ESP ([see supported devices](#supported-devices)).

Input2ESP also provides a plugin for [keepass2android](https://github.com/PhilippC/keepass2android), making it possible to send credentials directly from your password database to a computer. Since the ESP acts as a keyboard there is no need to install any additional programs.

## Supported Devices
Currently only the [ESPloitV2](https://github.com/exploitagency/ESPloitV2) firmware is supported (installed by default on the [Cactus WHID](https://github.com/whid-injector/WHID)).  
However, it is planned to create a custom ESP firmware that communicates encrypted over TCP and also to add support for [Wifi Duck](https://github.com/SpacehuhnTech/WiFiDuck).
